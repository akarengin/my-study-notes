🧠 Hash Maps & Sets Pattern

🚀 What Is It?

* You need fast lookup / membership check → HashSet

* You need frequency counting / mapping keys → HashMap

* You need constant-time indexing → Arrays

* Problems involve duplicates, counts, grouping, anagrams, subarrays

💡 When To Use It

Use this pattern when you encounter:

* "Find duplicates"

* "Check if a number was seen before"

* "Count the frequency of characters/numbers"

* "Track a mapping between two values"

* "Find a pair/triplet with some condition"

⏱ Complexity

* Array: Lookup O(1), Insert O(1), Remove O(1) (fixed size)

* HashSet: O(1) average

* HashMap: O(1) average
