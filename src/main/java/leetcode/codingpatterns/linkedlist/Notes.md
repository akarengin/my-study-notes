Mostly the problems problems rounds around the following approaches:

  * Two pointers

  * Merge linked list
 
  * Dummy node
 
  * Reverse linked list

ðŸ”¥ Core Patterns

| Pattern                    | Description                                              | Example Problems                                              |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Two Pointers (Fast & Slow) | Move one pointer faster to find middle or detect cycles. | Find Middle Node, Detect Cycle, Palindrome LinkedList         |
| Reverse LinkedList         | Reverse all or part of the list.                         | Reverse List, Reverse Sublist, Reorder List                   |
| Merge Two Lists            | Merge two sorted linked lists into one.                  | Merge Two Sorted Lists, Merge K Sorted Lists                  |
| Dummy Node Technique       | Use a dummy head to simplify pointer manipulations.      | Remove Nth Node, Partition List                               |
| Recursion                  | Use recursion to solve problems elegantly.               | Reverse LinkedList Recursively, Flatten Multilevel LinkedList |


ðŸŽ¯ Pro Tip

Always use a dummy node when modifying the head of the list â€” it avoids a lot of edge case headaches.
