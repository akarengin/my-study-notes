**Bubble Sort** is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list of numbers.
* It compares adjacent numbers,and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 
* This process continues until the list is sorted. 
* The largest unsorted element "bubbles up" to its correct position after each pass through the list.

**Selection sort** is a sorting algorithm that selects the smallest element from an unsorted part 
in each iteration and places that element at the beginning of the unsorted part.
